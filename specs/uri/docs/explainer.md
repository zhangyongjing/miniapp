## 1. Introduction

### What is this?

MiniApp URI Scheme defines the Uniform Resource Identifier of a MiniApp ([What is MiniApp?](https://w3c.github.io/miniapp/white-paper/#what-is-miniapp)).

Applications including Web applications can use MiniApp URI Scheme to claim the MiniApp resource it's trying to reference.

### Why should we care?

Each MiniApp vendors, i.e. the MiniApp packaging service providers, are now using very different methods to obtain the MiniApp package. Meanwhile, every user agent has their own way to describe a MiniApp resource. This is creating difficulty to visit a MiniApp across platforms.

For example:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr class="thead-first-child"><th align="left"> User Agent    </th><th align="left"> URI                                                             </th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr class="tbody-first-child"><td align="left"> Wechat App    </td><td align="left"> <code>weixin://dl/&lt;path&gt;/?appid=&lt;appId&gt;&amp;businessType=&lt;businessType&gt;</code> </td></tr>
        <tr class="tbody-even-child"><td align="left"> Alipay App    </td><td align="left"> <code>alipays://platformapi/startapp?appId=&lt;appId&gt;&amp;url=&lt;path&gt;</code>       </td></tr>
        <tr class="tbody-odd-child"><td rowspan="3" align="left"> Quick App     </td><td align="left"> <code>http://hapjs.org/app/&lt;package&gt;/[path][?key=value]</code>             </td></tr>
        <tr class="tbody-even-child"><td align="left"> <code>https://hapjs.org/app/&lt;package&gt;/[path][?key=value]</code>            </td></tr>
        <tr class="tbody-odd-child"><td align="left"> <code>hap://app/&lt;package&gt;/[path][?key=value]</code>                        </td></tr>
        <tr class="tbody-even-child"><td align="left"> Baidu App     </td><td align="left"> <code>baiduboxxapp://swan/appKey/path?key=value</code>                     </td></tr>
        <tr class="tbody-odd-child"><td rowspan="2" align="left"> Bytedance App </td><td align="left"> <code>sslocal://microapp?app_id=&lt;appId&gt;&amp;start_page=pages/home/home</code>  </td></tr>
        <tr class="tbody-even-child"><td align="left"> <code>snssdk143://microapp?app_id=&lt;appId&gt;&amp;start_page=&lt;path&gt;</code>         </td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## 2. Goals

The MiniApp URI Scheme specification aims to provide a set of conform syntax rules to concatenate the information of a miniapp, such as id, version, package address, so that the user agents can identify, parse, and obtain the miniapp resource on any platform.

The miniapp URI achieve this goal by the following design:

* Identify the miniapp package resource by its id, host, port and version components. In most cases, through host and IP, a user agent can discover a miniapp package management service, then access a specific miniapp package by providing the unique ID and version of the miniapp.
* Identify the resource inside miniapp package by its path, query and fragment components. The definition of these three components is close to a HTTP url in browser. How those components can be used relies on other miniapp specs, especially, the [MiniApp Packaging specification](https://w3c.github.io/miniapp/specs/packaging/).

### Key Considerations

#### Why is host and port needed?

If there is no host and port, we'd have to build a unique and centralized miniapp package manager, which is considered difficult and cannot satisfy the demand of the current development of miniapp in China.

In addition, we expect to support a variety of ways to get miniapp packages by URI besides downloading from Internet, such as local files. In this case, the host may not be considered as a domain.

#### Where does id come from?

Only id uniqueness in host is required. May use some algorithm to generate a universally unique id, or there exists some third party miniapp registers. This depends on the host the miniapp belong to.

#### Why is version components needed?

When a user visits a web page, the page content is always up to date. This is the same for miniapp in most cases, so the version  in miniapp URI usually is null. But in some cases, a user agent or user needs to access some specific versions of miniapp. So we reserve the version component.

## 3. Non-goals

The following titles are also important but out of the scope of the MiniApp URI Scheme draft report:

1. the identifier of the resource within a miniapp package, which may include path, query, fragment (this may be defined in the [packaging specification](https://w3c.github.io/miniapp/specs/packaging/));
2. the storage and management of a miniapp package;
3. how to generate the id of a miniapp package;
4. the rule to define a version number;
5. how the Web developers obtain the id and version of a miniapp package;
6. how to obtain a miniapp package (we just provide a suggested way to obtain the package as [an use case](https://w3c.github.io/miniapp/specs/uri/#https)).

## 4. Key scenarios

### Scenario 1 A link to a miniapp in a web page

<p><img width="500px" src="https://images-cdn.shimo.im/BqkA6Gqh1CQArUFl/image.png__thumbnail" alt="figure1. the use case which link to a miniapp in a web page" /></p>

Example code:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<a href="miniapp://foo;version=1.0.1-trial@example.com:8080/pages/index?category=book#section-3">open a MiniApp</a>
</html>
```

Browsers may handle the click action of Link A inconsistently for this Web page.

* If it is running in a web page or MiniApp page or Native App that has a miniapp runtime, the URI can be parsed properly, and it will be retrieved  the resource from the *example.com*, then locate the URI path, query, fragment and other information to dereference the corresponding resource.
* If it is in a web page of or Native App that does not have a miniapp runtime, the platform can parse the URI properly but can not run the miniapp resource. To provide a smooth user experience, it may trigger other user agent to open the miniapp.

### Scenario 2 Use MiniApp URI within a miniapp

Similar to parsing the URLs of each parts of the context for a web page, in MiniApp's runtime context, developers also need to know all the necessary information of the URI corresponding to the current MiniApp page. These information may include,

```javascript
console.log(location.href);     // miniapp://foo;version=1.0.1-trial@example.com:8080/pages/index?k=v#bar
console.log(location.protocol); // miniapp:
console.log(location.origin);   // miniapp://foo;version=1.0.1-trial@example.com:8080
console.log(location.id);       // foo
console.log(location.version);  // 1.0.1-trial
console.log(location.host);     // example.com
console.log(location.port);     // 8080
console.log(location.pathname); // /pages/index
console.log(location.search);   // ?k=v
console.log(location.hash);     // #bar
```

More use case of MiniApp can be found in the [MiniApp White Paper use case](https://w3c.github.io/miniapp/white-paper/#case-studies).

## 5. Security and Privacy Considerations

### Security

1. Similar to other URLs, MiniApp URI may expose the host and port of a miniapp package, so there may be a risk of being scanned and attacked for the other hidden ports. Service providers are suggested to avoid the risks through authentication or other efficient means.
2. When the UA reads and dereferences the URI, there maybe security risks such as injection, hijacking, and man-in-the-middle attacks during the requests to obtain the package from the service provider. User agents are suggested to send requests using HTTPS and data encryption. Packet integrity and security validation can also help to identify and terminate abnormal URI access to tampered package files.
3. When the user agent stores the package resource locally, it is necessary to ensure the storage security of files and isolate them properly.

### Privacy

1. User Agent should isolate the resources of the local package. Only the current miniapp can cache or access these resources, while other miniapp or applications are not supposed to. In addition, the user agent needs to obfuscate the resource names and provide mapping for the paths of the stored files, to prevent file privacy leaks.
2. User agent should restrict the permissions of the miniapp to access certain information, miniapp can only access the user's private information (such as user address, mobile number, or email) after the user has authorized.

## 6. Detailed design discussions

The proposal of the URI scheme is still in an early stage. The main form of discussion are meetings and offline communication. All of the discussion has been recorded in [the Q&A document](./Q&A.md)
